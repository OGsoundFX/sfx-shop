// Appart from font-family and color, all the components applied to the html, body and
// content, are to fix the footer at the bottom of the pages. The class "content"
// has to be applied on every page that displays the footer.
// 1- fixing the height of the pages (without footer) at 100%. If content exceeds
// 100% of the vh, the footer will be pushed down, otherwise the footer will be
// sticking to the bottom of the page
// 2- Applying a VERTICAL flex property to the body, so the contents will be alligned
// vertically. Here the content are the "content" and the "footer"
// 3- Apllying the flex properties to the content:
//    - flex-growth: 1 (grows to fill in empty space)
//    - flex-shrink: 0 (does not shrink to its minimum size to fit the container)
//    - flex-basis: auto (no predefined size, depends on size of content)
