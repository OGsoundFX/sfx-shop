  This large pack of Outdoor sounds includes a wide variety of loops to illustrate your different outdoor atmospheres. Over 60 different soundscapes, including mountain, desert, tundra, a variety of forests, swamp, snowy lands, and also fantasy atmospheres like dragon lands, ice lands, ever growing meadows and much more! You will also find night and day versions for several environments, and separate layers from these atmospheres to re-create your own environments to your liking. A selection of animal sounds and outdoor elements are also included to help you add more life to your sound atmospheres.
