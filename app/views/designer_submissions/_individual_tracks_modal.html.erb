      <h4>🎧 Sell Individual Tracks</h4>
      <p>Each of your sound effects is available for individual purchase. This gives users the flexibility to buy only what they need, whether it's one sound or a dozen.</p>

      <h4>🎛️ Custom Collections</h4>
      <p>Every track you upload is also automatically available for users to add to their own custom collections.</p>
      <p>Users build their own bundles by selecting multiple individual sounds.</p>
      <p>The more they add, the bigger the discount.</p>
      <p>You still get paid per track—just like with single purchases.</p>

      <h4>Why it matters</h4>
      <p>This system gives your sounds maximum exposure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Sold individually</li>
        <li>✅ Included in user-created collections</li>
        <li>✅ Featured in full sound packs</li>
      </ul>
