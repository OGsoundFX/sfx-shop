# BAMSFX ONLINE SHOP - README # _(Work in Progress)_

Hello,
Here is my online Sound Effects shop that I am building. The first stage is completed and the app is up and running here: https://www.bamsfx.com

## THE DIFFERENT STAGES I AM AIMIMG FOR WITH THIS APP

Here are the different stages that I am aiming:

1/ Stage 1: **COMPLETED** (almost)
Creating a Sound Effects online shop with only my Own sound effects packs.
I am first releasing a Demo version for friends and coleagues, with free access to all sound effect packs. Official release will come soon after.
What still need to be done:
- devise confirmation email when creating an account
- problem with password reset
- some frontend details
- add reviews

2/ Stage 2: Early 2021
Invite other sound designers to sell their Sound Effect packs. They will be able to create their accounts and upload their assets after quality validation from me.
Details need to be established.

3/ Stage3: Later in 2021
Make your own pack: The customer can purchase sounds individually or make their own packs with hand picked sounds, in order to benefit from "pack prices" while not having to purchase pre-made packs. Gives more flexibillity to the customer with smaller budgets.

4/ Additional feature:
- Player: An option for board game players (like DnD) to have access to ALL sounds available and create their own playlist curated for their sessions. This option will prbably work through subscription (24h - 7day - monthly)
- Custom work: for clients to ask for custom designs for their projects. They can ask one of the sound designers from the website, or make open offers.

I will add details about how I build this app and the various tools I used (devise, postgresql, cloudinary, stripe, heroku...) soon!
